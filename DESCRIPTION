Description: This package was created as an assignment for my Data Science I course. Currently, this package contains 
 functions that will allow you to extract or plot DRG data from the data.cms.gov. This package currently only contains 
 two functions drg_stats and drg_plot for the user to calculate statistics by DRG codes and create boxplots by DRG code.
    This function contains data stored in the variable DRG_data. This data can be used to run the functions within the 
 package.
